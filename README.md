# bookify_pdf
This is a python program which reorders pdf contents so that you can make a tiny portable pdf book.
Ideally the size of each page should be A5 and 2 pages should fit horizontally in one side of A4 paper.
Before you print out the pdf, make sure double sided printing are enabled.
After printed out, just fold them and you'll have a book.
